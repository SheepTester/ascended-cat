Scratch for three.js

### Issues

- Dragging blocks does not update the scroll bars
- Inserting a block inside a C block does not update scroll bounds (and presumably its `measurements`)
- Drag scroll bars (Should the scroll bars be SVG `rect`s or HTML `div`s?)

### TODO

- A proper palette (with scrollbar)
- RTL support
- Angle picker and other argument types
- Right click > Relabel, duplicate
