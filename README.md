Scratch for three.js

### Issues

- Inserting a block inside a C block does not update scroll bounds (and presumably its `measurements`)
- Drag scroll bars

### TODO

- A proper palette (with scrollbar)
- RTL support
- Angle picker and other argument types
- Right click > Relabel, duplicate
- Zoooom
